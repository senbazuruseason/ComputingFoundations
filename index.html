        I grew up with the internet and came to love computers at an early age. I created my first website using
        Angelfire when I was a teenager as a reaction to a boy that had broken my friend's heart. My older brother took
        apart computers in his spare time, and I tagged with him to LAN parties that his friend who owned a computer
        shop hosted. So while computers have always been a part of my life, I did not completely dive in to my interest
        until the creation of the Google DeepDream Project. After a steep learning curve and many hours spent
        metaphorically banging my head against a wall, I realized that this sort of challenge was something that I
        loved. Since, then I have been been investigating and playing with technology in various ways. </p>
